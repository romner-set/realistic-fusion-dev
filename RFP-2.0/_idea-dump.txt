Fuel gets pre-heated in heaters to near fusion temp so most of the heating isn't done by the reactor, then transported at low pressure to prevent accidental fusion & loss of energy
Fusion controller
    - sensors:
        magnetic confinement:
            # plasma pressure/density
            # plasma temperature
            # plasma mass
            # fusion rate
            # energy output
            # tritium breeding rate
            # reactor wall integrity (repaired manually)
        inertial confinement:
            # stored input energy
            # stored output energy (heat for neutronic, charged particles for aneutronic)
            # energy per impulse (used, produced)
            # tritium breeding rate
            # reactor wall integrity (repaired manually?, later self-repairing)
    - variables:
        magnetic confinement:
            # magnetic field strength (slider) - controls plasma pressure/density and in turn the fusion rate etc
            # plasma flow (speed slider + direction switch / speed slider with negative values) - optimal flow makes confinement easier and so lowers the needed magnet strength
            # plasma heating (slider) - controls plasma temperature and in turn the fusion rate etc
        inertial confinement:
            # force a pulse immediately (button)
            # seconds between pulses (better algorithms allow lower values) - not applicable for non-algorithmic controllers
    - optimal values can change drastically over time, all depend on each other
    - several tiers based on tech
        T1: manual/static
            # players manually change variables through a GUI
            # least efficient unless there's someone constantly monitoring it, at which point it can be as good as adv. algorithms
        T2: remote-controlled
            # buttons always on-screen to bring up reactor interfaces, players can change variables anytime
            # otherwise same as above
        T2: basic algorithms
            # dynamically changes variables
            # slow and generally not great at its job, but fully automatic and better than not changing anything
            # "if A <= _ do X, if B > _ do Y" etc
        T3: advanced algorithms
            # also dynamically changes variables
            # almost real-time, but not completely accurate
            # "if A <= _ && B >= _ do X, if B >= _ || C == _ do Y" etc
        T4: AI-assisted
            # dynamically changes variables accounting for what's gonna happen next
            # real-time, very accurate
            # can optimize so well that self-sustaining fusion is possible with certain fuels (without the need for a heater except on startup)

?Non-ICF fusion can be boosted for a short amount of time by throwing an ICF fuel pellet into the reactor
