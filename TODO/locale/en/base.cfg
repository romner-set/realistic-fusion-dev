rf-fusion-theory=So, now that I've split the atom, what happens if I smash atoms together?
rf-plasma-handling=Apparently gas millions of degrees hot can't be contained by some iron pipes. Jon learned the hard way.
rf-fusion-reactor=I need a reactor that can contain the high temperature plasma required for fusion.
rf-heat-exchanger=Energy produced by fusion must be converted to heat to produce electricity.
rf-d-d-fusion=For now fusion consumes more energy than it produces, but that will change soon.
rf-d-t-fusion=D-T fusion[recipe=rf-d-t-fusion-0] produces way more energy than D-D. But not enough.
rf-aneutronic-fusion-theory=A second generation approach to nuclear fusion. Instead of neutrons carrying most of the energy, in aneutronic fusion most of the energy is carried by charged particles. This allows converting energy generated by aneutronic fusion directly to electricity.
rf-aneutronic-reactor=A reactor that can handle the much higher temperatures and pressures required for aneutronic fusion.
rf-direct-energy-conversion=Aneutronic fusion allows to directly convert its energy to electricity, instead of converting it to heat and then using the steam cycle.

rf-d-he3-mix=D-He3 fusion[recipe=rf-d-he3-fusion-0] can occur at lower temperatures and produces more energy than He3-He3[recipe=rf-he3-he3-fusion-0]. First step is mixing and heating deuterium and helium-3.
rf-d-he3-fusion=D-He3[recipe=rf-d-he3-fusion-0] produces way more power than anything that came before it. This should produce enough for almost anything.
rf-portable-reactor=Produces a lot of energy, but needs fuel cells.

rf-operations-per-tick=Lower values mean better performance but you may be able to pipe plasma using iron pipes. Set to 0 to disable (only lower if every tenth of an UPS matters or you're too lazy to use magnetic confinement pipes[item=rf-pipe], and only make it higher if you have a LOT of pipes placed. (16*60 = 960 pipes processed/s default)).\n\n[color=#008cff]DEFAULT = 16[/color]

rf-antimatter=Enables power production from matter-antimatter annihilation. You will never have to worry about energy ever again if you build just a single power plant. Needs a LOT of power to kickstart. [color=#ff0000]Currently WIP, there will propably be more researches/complexity in the future.[/color]\n\n[color=#008cff]DEFAULT = ON[/color]
rf-hc-stuff=A single D-T reactor produces 1.4GW to 2GW (depending on efficiency upgrades). Yes, it's possible to use vanilla heat exchangers and turbines, but it's much easier and UPS efficient to use these.\n\nWith SE they aren't as useful because SE has their own "high temperature" heat exchanger and turbine, but I still recommend leaving it on because you get RFP D-T fusion much much earlier than you can get SE exchangers and turbines.\n\n[color=#008cff]DEFAULT = ON[/color]

Increases loading time. Does nothing without advanced deuterium extraction.\n\n[color=#008cff]DEFAULT = ON[/color]

heating=Lower energy losses of heating __1__[fluid=__2__].
tritium-breeding=D-D fusion[recipe=rf-d-d-fusion-0-0] produces tritium[fluid=__1__] 50% of the time and D-T fusion[recipe=rf-d-t-fusion-0] is much better at producing electricity than D-D. I should find a way to extract the tritium[fluid=__1__].
helium-3-breeding=Helium-3[fluid=__1__] is a very good candidate for aneutronic fusion and D-D[recipe=rf-d-d-fusion-0-0] produces either tritium[fluid=__2__] or helium-3[fluid=__1__] with a 50/50 chance. I already know how to extract the tritium[fluid=__2__], so now it's time to extract the helium-3[fluid=__1__] too.
d-d-heating=Fusion happens at millions of degrees C. I need a way to get deuterium[fluid=__1__] to those temperatures somehow.
gas-mixing=I need to mix deuterium[fluid=__1__] and tritium[fluid=__2__] to achieve D-T fusion[recipe=rf-d-t-fusion-0].
d-t-heating=Now that I can make the D-T mixture[fluid=__1__], I need to heat it.
helium-3-heating=Now that I can breed helium-3[fluid=__1__], I need to heat it to the insane temperature of 2 billion C.
particle-acceleration=Let's see what happens when subatomic particles[fluid=__1__][fluid=__2__] go almost as fast as they can and collide.
antimatter-theory=Apparently there are "antiparticles"[fluid=__1__][fluid=__2__] that have the opposite charge of their normal particle counterparts[fluid=__3__][fluid=__4__] and if particles and antiparticles touch they annihilate and release 100% of their mass as usable energy. This could be used for power generation that would make even D-He3 fusion [recipe=rf-d-he3-fusion-0] obsolete. I'll need to keep colliding to see how though.
particle-deceleration=First I need to figure out how to slow down the high-energy antiparticles[fluid=__1__][fluid=__2__] produced in the accelerators[entity=rf-particle-accelerator].
tritium-decay=Tritium[fluid=__1__] can decay to the much more useful helium-3[fluid=__2__] with a half-life of 12.5 years. That's way too long, there has to be a way to speed up the process.
deuterium-extraction=Deuterium[fluid=__1__] seems to be a suitable fuel for fusion.
gs-process-name=Girdler-sulfide process [__1__% to __2__%]
gs-process-description=Uses hydrogen sulfide[fluid=__1__] to concentrate heavy water[fluid=__2__] before boiling it. Much more energy efficient than boiling water[fluid=water] directly.\n\n[color=#008cff]NOTE: Hydrogen sulfide[fluid=__1__] is only used as a catalyst, you don't need to set up permanent production of it.[/color]
gs-process=Allows concentrating heavy water[fluid=__1__] even more before purifying it with an electric boiler, further improving energy efficiency.

antimatter-processor=Can process antimatter[fluid=__1__][fluid=__2__][fluid=__3__] without exploding violently.

bk-thread=Realistic Fusion Power
bk-deuterium-extraction=Advanced Deuterium Extraction
bk-deuterium-extraction-text=Separating heavy water from ordinary water is an energy-intensive task. The easiest (and most ineffective) way is boiling water to precisely 100°C. That way the ordinary water will boil away, while the heavy water (with a 1° higher boiling point) will stay liquid. The harder (but more efficient method) is using hydrogen sulfide as a catalyst to enrich the water to 5, 10 or 20% heavy water before boiling. After you have the heavy water, you can electrolyse it into pure deuterium and oxygen. Here are some numbers:

bk-n/a= [color=#ff0000]N/A[/color] 
bk-fusion=Fusion Power
bk-fusion-text=First you need to heat whatever fuel you want to fuse into plasma. After that, pipe it into the reactor. Reactor should be connected to a fusion heat exchanger, which produces the heat you can then turn into electricity with heat exchangers+turbines. Aneutronic fusion skips the heat part, and directly produces electricity. Heating consumes a lot of energy, so you first need some kind of power plant to provide enough before it can sustain itself with the energy it produces.\nHere are some spreadsheets of the net power produced/consumed not accounting for deuterium extraction (negative values mean it consumes more power than it produces, anything above 0 should be self-sustainable):

bk-antimatter=Antimatter Power [WIP]
bk-antimatter-text=To get antimatter, you first need to accelerate and then collide particles in a particle accelerator, then decelerate the antimatter particles that remain. To produce energy, make matter-antimatter fuel cells and put them in the reactor. Particle ac/decelerators consume a lot of energy, so you'll need atleast a He3-He3 fusion power plant already set up to kickstart it. Antimatter power is still WIP and will be improved in the future.
